## üåç Overview
We propose **NKS-GR**, a scalable feature selection framework for **hyperspectral image (HSI) classification**.  
Our method integrates:
- **Spectral and spatial graph regularization**  
- **Sparsity-inducing penalties** ($\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, log-sum, etc.)  
- **Nystr√∂m approximation** for efficient pixel-wise graph construction  

The framework is evaluated on benchmark HSI datasets such as *Indian Pines*, *Salinas*, *Botswana*, and *Brain*.  
It achieves **comparable or better accuracy** than full graph construction while drastically reducing **runtime** and **memory usage**.
